## Project Description

Zest is a web app that lets users find and sort recipes. It uses the Tasty API and features a modern design which is light, fully responsive and accessible. By default users can browse an entire page of recipes. Users can search for recipes by their ingredients (such as *cheese*). 

## Major Functions and Features

1. **Browse recipes:** The landing page features a list of recipe cards, which contain information about ingredients, cooking times and step-by-step directions. Each of the recipes contains a picture of the dish and a nutritional chart. The recipes displayed are fetched using the Tasty API.

2. **Find recipes:** By interacting with the search bar, the user can look for recipes entering an ingredient (such as *butter*, *chicken* or *carrot*). The results show up on the main page when the user use the search bar.

3. **Responsive design:** The website is made fully responsive on all viewports using flex and media queries, and it features cards in a layout of 5 to 1 columns.

4. **Dark mode:** There is an integrated dark mode for accessibility, which can be switched to using a toggle on the top right corner of the website. The website colors pass the AAA test on the Web Accessibility Guidelines, and they are both legible and easy on the eyes.
