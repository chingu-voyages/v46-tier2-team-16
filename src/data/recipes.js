With the motor running, drizzle in 1-2 tbsp cold water until the dough starts to form in clumps.

Shape into a disc, wrap and chill for 30 mins or overnight.",

Dust a sheet of baking parchment large enough to line a large baking tray with flour, then roll the pastry out to a roughly 30cm circle on top of the parchment. The pastry will crack and crumble a little as you roll it, but just keep pushing the edges back together – don’t worry if it looks rustic. Slide the pastry on its parchment onto the baking tray. Pile the apple slices into the centre of the pastry circle using your hands, letting any excess syrup drip back into the bowl as you do (save the syrup for later). Be sure to leave a clear 2cm border around the edge. Use the baking parchment to help you lift the edges of the pastry over the apples, leaving the most of the apples exposed. Pinch together any cracks around the edge to make a rustic pastry border.",
			"Brush the pastry edge with some beaten egg, sprinkle with a little extra brown sugar and scatter over the hazelnuts. Bake for 50-55 mins until golden brown. Meanwhile, pour any leftover syrup from the apples into a small saucepan and bubble for a few minutes until syrupy. When the galette is cooked and still hot, brush the syrup over the top.
